# Quick Quiz Web Application

Quick Quiz is a simple web application designed to provide users with an interactive quiz experience. It features multiple-choice questions fetched from an external API, a scoring system, and a high scores leaderboard.

## Project Structure

The project consists of several HTML files, CSS stylesheets, and JavaScript files organized as follows:

- **index.html**: The landing page of the application. It provides options to start playing the quiz or view high scores.
- **game.html**: The page where the quiz is played. It displays questions, choices, and tracks the user's score and progress.
- **end.html**: The page displayed after completing the quiz. It shows the user's final score and allows them to save their score and play again.
- **highscores.html**: The page displaying the leaderboard of high scores achieved by users.
- **assets/css/app.css**: The main CSS file containing styles shared across all pages.
- **assets/game/game.css**: Additional CSS styles specific to the game page.
- **assets/highscore/highscores.css**: Additional CSS styles for the high scores page.
- **game.js**: JavaScript file responsible for fetching quiz questions, managing game logic, and handling user interactions during the quiz.
- **end.js**: JavaScript file handling the end of the quiz, including displaying the final score and saving high scores.
